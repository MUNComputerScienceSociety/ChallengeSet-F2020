For this set of challenges, we will be using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as our coding challenge.

## What is Advent of Code:

Advent of code is a 25-day long coding challenge that posts two daily festive themed coding puzzles from December 1st until December 25th. New puzzles unlock at 1:30 AM NST. The first 100 users submitted on the site get entered on the leaderboard. Each challenge that is completed earns one "Star", the second challenge for each day is unlocked when the first one is completed.

## How will we use Advent of code:

Since finals are currently underway, we will accept any of the puzzle solutions at any point during this event until December 25th at 11:59 NST. This means that anybody who has already completed some puzzles can submit their answers for ballots, and it gives people a chance to finish as many puzzles as they want after exams are finished. **Each day completed will earn one ballot towards our end of the year raffle.** 

## How to submit: 

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Place your submission within this directory (`set-02/`), in a sub-directory that is your mun name, or simply GitHub username (ex. `week1/jaharrhy`, `week1/nint8836`, `week1/Mudkip`, `week1/Inefy`, etc.)
3. Ensure that your submission works within said directory, along with instructions on how to run the code:
