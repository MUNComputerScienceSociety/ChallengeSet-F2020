# Week 1 (November 17th, 2020)

Welcome to the first week of _ChallengeSet_, a _set_ of _challenges_ we're planning on putting out every week of this semester!

This first week is a tidy little introduction one: below you'll find a few misc. Kattis problems we've picked out for you to try:

[Job Expenses](https://open.kattis.com/problems/jobexpenses)

[Pig Latin](https://open.kattis.com/problems/piglatin)

[Block Game](https://open.kattis.com/problems/blockgame2)


## How do I use Kattis?

You can use Kattis' [Python 3 Help](https://open.kattis.com/help/python3) section for information, or something like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NHyzBN4GAM).

If none of that works, feel free to reach out in the Discord for help on getting your program running!

## Testing your Solutions

Sample input and output for all problems have been given under the subdirectory `week-01/test-samples/`. The input files must be piped into your solution in order to test them.

An example command for doing this for an arbitrary python solution is `cat test-samples/<problemid>/<sample-numbe/r>-input.in | python <username>/<problemid>.py` . 

The expected output for any given solution is found under the subdirectory `week-01/test-samples/<problemid><sample-numbe/r>-output.ans` .  

## Submitting Solutions

Submissions to problems can be submitted past **December 1st, 2020 @ 11:59PM**, please don't distribute submissions to GitHub before this date, so every one has a chance to do their own thing before this time!

Either you can:

### Use GitHub

This is the preferable method, since learning git is a very useful skill in itself!

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Place your submission within this directory (`week1/`), in a sub-directory that is your mun name, or simply GitHub username (ex. `week1/jaharrhy`, `week1/nint8836`, `week1/Mudkip`, `week1/Inefy`, etc.)
3. Ensure that your submission works within said directory, along with instructions on how to run the code:

> How to run my code: ...
> 
> Here is the command I ran to run my code: `cat input.txt | python solution.py`

### Contact an Executive

If you're not comfortable with git, feel free to reach out to me with your code, so I can submit it to this repository for you instead:

- Zac (Dr.Swag#9148)

## What do I get out of it?

- Programming practice
- git practice, & GitHub contributions
- _Bragging rights_, since you'll be noted within the root `README.md` of this project as a contributor
- Entries into the **raffle** at the end of the year where we will be giving away a number of prizes!
